## Project Description:
As noticed by many academics, user-generated content (UGC) is an abundant source of data that reflects more accurate customer attitudes. By applying text analytics tools to UGC data, key themes and user sentiments, as well as information about whether a certain brand is under the spotlight, can be detected and displayed. 

#### In our case, we set our eyes to the Edmunds car forum. Based on the UGC collected from the forum, our objective is 
1. to find out the most frequently mentioned car brands and car attributes
2. to examine how the users associate the brands
3. to know in terms of which attributes they usually compare two brands. 

These findings that shed light on users' attitudes, when properly visualized and interpreted, will help form business insights that can be offered to product managers and marketing managers.

## Project Description
In this project, we will explore what role the social media (Twitter) played during the famous Ice Bucket Challenge campaign in 2014 and how it influenced the trend of this charity
movement from two perspectives: first, we will apply methods such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis to investigate the thoughts and attitudes of Twitter users had towards this
campaign. By integrating scores generated with time labels, we could come up with detailed trend plots to gain a deeper understanding. Second, network analysis will be used to examine
how the ALS association and other influencers/ celebrities contributed to this campaign.

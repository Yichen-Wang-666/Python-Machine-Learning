## Project Description
This assignment involves building and testing classification models to predict salaries from the text contained in the job descriptions. The data for this assignment can be found at
http://www.kaggle.com/c/job-salary-prediction.

2500 data points were randomly selected from the training dataset (“Train_rev1.csv”) for ease of analysis. Naïve Bayes classifier models were created to predict high (75th percentile and above) or low (below 75th
percentile) salary from the text contained in the job descriptions.

## Code Description
An rnn-based model is developed to perform classification. The goal is threefold:

1. Preprocessing procedures required for performing text classification from A to Z.
2. Use embeddings and RNNs in conjunction at the character level to perform classification.
3. Write a function that takes as input a string, and outputs the name of the predicted class.

## Project Description
500 images are scraped from Discovery Channel's Instagram page. With the image labelling from Google Vision, topic modelling (LDA) is performed and topics are generated.

Data is sorted from high to low engagement (number of comments), and average topic weights of images across the highest and lowest quartiles are compared.

From the result we could see that those posts with high interactions differ from those within low quartile in 2 topics: natural environments and Human & Earth. For posts in high quartile, more posts within Human & Earth are posted, where for posts in low quartile, more in natural environment are posted. But overall, the difference is small, and require more explanatory factors to explain the difference in the number of interactions.

According to the table above, there isnâ€™t such obvious differences between topics for posts in high and low quartiles. Therefore, the problem may not be the topic of the post, but the quality of the post instead. However, according to the result, discovery inc. could try to post more related to Human & Earth related posts, such as technology and arts.

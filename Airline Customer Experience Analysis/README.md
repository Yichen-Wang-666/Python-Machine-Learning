## Project Description
Different from previous times that public opinions were created mainly by commentators and media, nowadays, through the internet, everyone’s reviews and opinions can be heard. The "trails” and “voices” that users left on online platforms, known as user-generated content (UGC), are considered to be able to reflect a less distorted consumer attitude.

In our case, in order to compare airlines in terms of customer experience, we collect and analyze related UGCs rather than trusting polished news articles or advertisements produced by airlines themselves. With the UGC text analytical result in hand, we would be able to help airlines to engage in real-time interactions with potential customers and to generate insights for both airlines and consumers.

#### More specifically, we aim to 
1. analyze popular airlines and understand whether people show positive or negative sentiments about each one of them as well as
2. providing customized recommendations of airlines to segmented customers based on their preferences by leveraging sentiment analysis and airlines segmentation
3. providing advice to airlines about which attributes to improve to effectively alleviate customer experience.
